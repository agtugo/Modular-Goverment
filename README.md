# Modular-Goverment
Design of new modular meta-government using web based collaboration techniques.

CREATE A META-GOVERMENT SYSTEM DEFINING A MINIMUM GOVERMENT REQUIRED TO RUN A COUNTRY AND THEN DEFINE MODULES THAT CAN TAKE OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES SIMILIAR TO THE DESIGN OF A OPERATING SYSTEM MICROKERNEL AND SERVICES, WHERE THE MICROKERNEL IS THE MINIMUM GOVERMENT REQUIERED TO RUN A COUNTRY WHICH CAN BE BASED ON , FEDERALISM, CENTRALISM, REPUBLIC, CAPITALISM, COMMUNISM, SOCIALISM, MIXED ECONOMY OR ANOTHER MICROKERNEL.

MAYBE THE TERM MICROKERNEL IS NOT THE MOST ADEQUATE term I'LL THINK TO INSTEAD USE THE TERM MICROFRAMEWORK AND MODULES INSTEAD OF SERVICES.

The first country to apply this theorically is Mexico unless someone maps another country firt. I am going to map the mexican goverment and refactor in order to modularize. 

Mexico mapping (spanish due to facility):
