# Modular-Goverment
Design of new modular government using web based collaboration techniques 

CREATE A GOVERNENT SYSTEM USING A MICROKERNEL AND SERVICES, WHERE THE MICROKERNEL IS THE MINIMUM GOVERMENT REQUIERED TO RUN A COUNTRY 
WHICH CAN BE BASED ON CAPITALISM, COMMUNISM, SOCIALISM, MIXED ECONOMY OR ANOTHER MICROKERNEL.

MAYBE THE TERM MICROKERNEL IS NOT THE MOST ADEQUATE I'LL THINK TO INSTEAD USE THE TERM MICROFRAMEWORK AND MODULES INSTEAD OF SERVICES.
